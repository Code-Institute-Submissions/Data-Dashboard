         <p class="text-primary">Welcome to the Data Dashboard which provides knowledge on everything about cars getting towed in Chicago. This first chart respresents the number of cars towed for each car make, by hoving over the different bars you can see the direct total and the car make. Next to this graph is a discipline selector which you can use to change the data on the bar chart to see the colour of car which was towed for each make, you can easily use the selector to look at different colours just by selecting another option. Finally there is the pie chart which helps to show how many overall cars were towed for each colour. Dont forget you can use both the discipline seletor and pie chart to play around with all the other graphs and elements located on the page and if you don't like the data you are looking at just press the reset button at the top to go back to default.  </p>

         <p class="text-primary">Here we have a slightly more interesting bar chart because its a stacked bar, the data shown in this chart is the number of cars towed against different styles and these styles include four door, two door and SUV type of vechicles. like the chart before you just hover the different bars to see the data and the different styles are shown in different colours and with the use of the legend you can see what the style is. Next to this chart we have three lots of percentage counter with tell you the percentage of the different style cars towed in two different states, one being illinois and the other Indiana. Don't forgot to use the pie chart and so on to play with this data aswell. </p>

         <p class="text-primary">The Final Chart, its a small one but is shows the towed to location for all cars towed but once again with the use of this chart, the pie chart or the discipline selector to really narrow down on the data. Hope you enjoy the data dashboard.</p>
